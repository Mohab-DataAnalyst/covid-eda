# 🦠 COVID-19 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using MySQL

This project explores COVID-19 data using MySQL to analyze global and country-specific trends, including infection rates, death rates, and vaccination progress.


## ⚙️ Key Processes

- Analyzed COVID-19 case and death data

- Examined infection and death rates relative to the population

- Identified countries and continents with the highest impact

- Explored global COVID-19 trends over time

- Investigated vaccination progress worldwide
## 🔍 Key Findings
✅ Mortality Rate Analysis:
- Calculated the likelihood of death upon contracting COVID-19 globally and for Egypt.

- Identified countries with the highest death counts per population.

✅ Infection Rate Analysis:
- Determined the percentage of the population infected by COVID-19 in different countries.

- Found the countries with the highest infection rates relative to their population.

✅ Vaccination Progress:
- Analyzed global vaccination data.
- Created a rolling count of vaccinated individuals to assess the percentage of the population vaccinated over time.
## 🛠️ Technology Used
- SQL (MySQL): Used for data querying, cleaning, and analysis

## 📌 Getting Started 
### 🔧 **Requirements** 
- MySQL database system 🐬
- MySQL IDE (e.g., MySQL Workbench, DBeaver) 
- deaths and vaccinations tables containing COVID-19 data
 
▶️ **How to Run** 
- Open your MySQL IDE and connect to your database 
- Ensure the deaths and vaccinations tables are available 
- Run the SQL queries in sequence to analyze COVID-19 trends and vaccination progress
